**Research Question 3: Office space evacuation**  
_"How do office workspace layouts, furniture arrangements, and workstation configurations affect crowd evacuation dynamics and emergency egress efficiency in high-density office environments?"_

**Key Research Focus:**

- Investigate the impact of **workstation density and spatial arrangement** on evacuation flow patterns and bottleneck formation
- Analyze how **office furniture obstacles** (desks, chairs, filing cabinets, partitions) influence pedestrian movement and escape route accessibility
- Compare evacuation performance between **open-plan offices versus cubicle-based layouts** under various crowd density scenarios
- Develop **optimization algorithms** for office layout design that balance operational efficiency with emergency evacuation safety
